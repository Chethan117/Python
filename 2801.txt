Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check with you regarding the intent for handling the report related to approvals and declines.

Current/Previous Intent: The existing intent for the report has been to check for CPA bypass cases, with approval ranges typically between 27-32 days after a decline for monthly reports and 300-400 days for annual reports.

Impact: If we continue with the previous intent, we may miss cases where approvals occurred outside the specified time windows. This could affect quarterly or half-yearly reports, as well as approvals that happen after the specified days.

Proposed Intent: We are suggesting a new approach, where we would check for approvals that were declined within the last 365 days but were approved recently (within the last 7 days). This will capture more cases than the previous method, and while it might flag more cases, it would improve accuracy.

Additionally, we could enhance data quality by validating merchants that are not part of CPAs, such as purchases, as we move forward with this approach.

Please let us know which intent you would like us to proceed with.

Best regards,
