Subject: Script Execution and Data Cleanup for CPA Cases

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to inform you that I have successfully executed the script to pull cases for the period from [X] to [X]. Additionally, for the payment processor where customers had multiple subscriptions, I have filtered out unnecessary noise in the data and focused on retrieving the most recent approval for the same merchant. This will allow agents to reach out to the customer (CH) and work on the required CPAs effectively.

Currently, we will be manually running this process until the report is fully scheduled in Pascal, and the cases are loaded into Salesforce.

I will also be sending the sign-offs for the intent validation shortly once it is completed.

Additionally, during the data review, I noticed that there are cases where the merchant ID remains the same, but the acquiring BIN number has changed. This observation may require further investigation to ensure accuracy.

Please let me know if you need any further details or clarifications.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
