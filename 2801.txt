# Documentation of the Transaction Analysis and Reporting Process

## Intent and Background
The primary objective is to extract and analyze Visa and MasterCard transactions from the Broadcom database over the last three months to monitor and detect fraud. This process enhances security measures, ensures transaction integrity, manages data retention, and complies with data governance policies.

## Methodology
1. **Data Extraction**
   - Extract Visa and MasterCard transactions from the Broadcom database for the last three months.
   - Use PSD2 lookup and plastic cross-reference to obtain fraud status and account ID for each transaction.
2. **Transaction Status Analysis**
   - Apply 3DS1 and 3DS2 indicators to determine the security status of each transaction.
   - Calculate and categorize the outcomes to assess authenticity and potential fraud.
3. **Data Management**
   - Remove data older than 13 months and from the previous day's three-month period.
   - Insert new and relevant cases into the department table for ongoing analysis.
4. **Authentication and Alerts**
   - Identify phone numbers associated with accounts for OTP alerts.
   - Determine the OTP delivery method.
   - Union all authentications and split by method like successful, confirmed fraud, or assumed fraud.
5. **Visualization and Reporting**
   - Push the refined data to a department-specific table for visualization in Tableau.

## Non-Execution Impact
- **Increased Fraud Risk**: Lack of timely analysis and response to fraud can result in financial losses and decreased customer trust.
- **Data Compliance Violations**: Non-compliance with data retention policies can lead to legal and regulatory consequences.
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Inadequate data management may clutter systems, hindering swift data retrieval and analysis.
- **Security Breach Risks**: Insufficient monitoring of transaction security and authentication methods increases the risk of security breaches.
