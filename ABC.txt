## Review Logic for Decisions

| **Decision (What)**                                   | **Rationale (Why)**                                                                                                          | **Requirement** |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `COALESCE(ANI_DIGITS_TXT, 'anonymous')='anonymous'`   | To identify anonymous/withheld calls.                                                                                      | Review Logic    |
| `TSYS_DCLN_REAS_CD = '0560'`                          | Transaction declined due to CARD WATCH status present on the account.                                                      | Review Logic    |
| `TSYS_DCLN_REAS_CD = '0001'`                          | Identifies CAUTION ACCOUNT. Generated by the BLCK (Block) edit in the Consumer Decision Hierarchy when Tiered Watch is active. | Review Logic    |
| `TSYS_DCLN_REAS_CD = '0038'`                          | To OBTAIN POSITIVE ID – TS2 CONSUMER. Triggered when Tiered Watch status is escalated to L8, with a start date on/after today. | Review Logic    |
| `SUBSTR(TSYS_DCLN_REAS_CD, 1, 2) = '71'`              | Alternate processing logic is applied to handle specific conditions outside standard processing.                            | Review Logic    |
| `MRCH_CATG_CD < '0000'`                               | Identifies specific merchant category codes.                                                                               | Review Logic    |
| `AUTHZN_MSG_TYPE_MODR_CD IN ('0','1','4','5')`        | 0 = Purchase, 1 = Cash Advance (Not ATM), 4 = Cash Advance (ATM), 5 = Mail/Phone Order.                                    | Review Logic    |
| `POS_ENTRY_MTHD_CD IN ('01','81')`                    | Identifies Card Not Present on Keyed – manual and online transactions.                                                     | Review Logic    |
| `ACCT_PROD_CD IN ('L04','L08')`                       | Identifies the line of business (LOB) of the account, e.g., branded cards, partnerships (CCPF).                            | Review Logic    |
| `AUTHZN_RQST_TYPE_CD = '80'`                          | Identifies authorization events triggered by a change of address.                                                          | Review Logic    |

## What Does Alternate Processing Refer To?

Alternate processing refers to handling transactions or decisions that deviate from the standard workflow. For example, when certain codes (like `71`) are detected in decision logic, an alternative set of rules or procedures is applied to process these cases. This ensures unique conditions are addressed appropriately.

Alternate processing may involve:
- Applying custom business rules.
- Routing transactions for further review.
- Flagging transactions for manual processing by an agent.
