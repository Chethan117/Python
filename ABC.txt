Subject: Confirmation Request - Email Routing for Talos Work Stream and SAS Exit
Dear [Recipient],
Given the transition of the work stream to Talos and the SAS exit routing to Salesforce for exceptional reporting, I am seeking confirmation on whether the current email routing remains necessary.
Please advise on the continued requirements for email communication.
Thank you,
