1. Monthly Checks — Excluding PayPal:
Reason: PayPal transactions are common and often involve multiple legitimate recurring payments with varied names.
Benefit: Excluding PayPal transactions prevents false positives by filtering out frequent, low-risk transactions, allowing the system to focus on more suspicious patterns or merchants.
2. Yearly Checks — Extracting Microsoft Billing:
Reason: Microsoft handles many annual subscriptions (like Office 365) and uses consistent patterns in their merchant names (e.g., "Microsoft Billing," "MFSTBilling").
Benefit: Focusing on Microsoft Billing transactions annually helps detect potential bypass attempts that may go unnoticed in shorter-term checks. This targeted approach ensures that long-term or annual CPA issues are properly identified and reviewed.
