Additionally, during the SAS to Snowflake migration, I identified the potential risks of delays in obtaining department tables due to data quality checks, governance, and approvals. To mitigate this, I quickly assessed each new report, identified the necessary tables, and registered them in Zeus early in the process. This proactive strategy helped me stay on track with my tasks, exceed my targets, and shared this approach with the team to streamline our workflow.
