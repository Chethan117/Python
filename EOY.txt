Self-Evaluation: Year-End Competency Review
1. Communication
Rating: Very Strong
I consistently keep stakeholders informed, from discussing project changes with Mark and Joel to handling quick adjustments for data migrations, like when complaints data switched from CLARA to Salesforce. I make sure communication is clear and effective, and I’ve received positive feedback for my responsiveness.

2. Customer Focus
Rating: Exceptional
My main project involved automating metric-sharing with stakeholders, which saved a lot of manual effort. I’ve also been able to quickly adapt reports and data as business analysts need, helping them get the results they’re looking for.

3. Influence
Rating: Strong
Through consistent, reliable work, I’ve built trust with team members and stakeholders. This has helped me positively influence projects, especially during complex transitions like the SAS exit migration.

4. Job-Specific Skills
Rating: Exceptional
Since joining, I’ve built strong skills in SAS and Python, plus new tools like Legoland. During the SAS migration, I identified a missing lookup table in the direct debit report that was causing manual authorizations to be removed, which improved report accuracy and efficiency.

5. Judgment
Rating: Very Strong
I make sure to assess the impact of my decisions on the team and the project as a whole. For instance, I prioritized retiring unused reports and datamarts, which kept the system streamlined and reduced redundant work.

6. Lives the Values
Rating: Exceptional
I consistently monitor data quality, ensure reports load correctly, and check on critical metrics to help keep everything running smoothly. I also support the team during migrations and make sure targets are met, always aiming to add value.

7. Problem Solving
Rating: Very Strong
When the team needed adjustments during the CLARA to Salesforce migration, I was quick to address issues to keep things moving. The direct debit report example, where I identified the missing lookup table, is another instance where I proactively solved a problem that could have disrupted operations.

8. Results Focus
Rating: Exceptional
I make a point to not only hit my monthly targets but also take on extra tasks when possible. The automation project I led saved a lot of time for the team and reduced the manual effort involved in sharing metrics.

9. Teamwork
Rating: Very Strong
I regularly support the team with dual controls, help set up tables via Zeus, and pitch in for tasks like mobile app event changes. By assisting with daily checks and troubleshooting, I help keep our operations stable and our team coordinated.
