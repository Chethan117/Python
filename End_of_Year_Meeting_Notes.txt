1. Reflect on Your Growth
"This year has been a significant learning curve for me. I started without any knowledge of SAS or critical reporting processes. Over time, I learned SAS, Legoland, and Python, and successfully automated the manual monthly metrics reporting process. I also handled ad hoc requests whenever needed.

Despite the initial challenges after the SAS exit, I adapted quickly, ensured smooth processes, and identified potential issues like the direct debit and CPA failed blocks. I also assessed reports to determine their necessity before starting, improving efficiency."

2. Share Your Curiosity and Focus
"I’ve developed a strong curiosity about fraud reporting, including exception reporting and Salesforce tasks. I’m eager to explore these areas further next year, alongside the SAS exit as our primary focus."

3. Discuss Expectations
"As we’ve discussed before, I wanted to revisit the possibility of transitioning from a temporary FTC to a permanent position. I want to be transparent—being married and living in a shared house has been challenging. Clarity on this would help me decide on alternatives if needed."

4. Request a Flexible Work Arrangement
"I’d also like to request a hybrid work arrangement—two days in the office and three days remote. With my partner here, living in a shared house with all boys has been uncomfortable for her, and this flexibility would help."

5. End with Commitment
"I’m grateful for the opportunities I’ve had this year and remain committed to supporting the team’s goals, especially the SAS exit priority next year."
