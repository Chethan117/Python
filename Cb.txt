<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Extract Recent Fraud Transactions:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify all transactions flagged as fraud in the last <strong>10 days</strong> from the inbound recoverable dataset.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Filter Recent Debit Transactions:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Select only those transactions debited within the last <strong>120 days</strong> from Visa or MasterCard merchants.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Focus on Critical Transactions:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Further narrow down the transactions to those that occurred between <strong>120 days and 112 days</strong> from the current date.</li>
      <li>This ensures focus on transactions close to the chargeback eligibility deadline.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Check for Chargebacks:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Review the filtered transactions to determine if a chargeback has already been actioned.</li>
      <li>Extract the <strong>chargeback date</strong> and exclude all chargeback-completed transactions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Verify Merchant Credits:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Check for any credits received from merchants for the accounts associated with the remaining transactions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid Duplicate Processing:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare the extracted transactions with <strong>yesterday's flagged cases</strong> to ensure duplicates are not included.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Push Non-Worked Transactions to Tables:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Insert the final list of non-duplicate transactions into the <strong>daily table</strong> and the <strong>repo table</strong> for tracking.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Send to Operational Workstream:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Share the prepared list with the <strong>operational workstream</strong> for further investigation and resolution.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Script Decision Rationale and Requirements</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Rationale:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fraud Transactions in the Last 10 Days:</strong> Focuses on recent cases to capture actionable fraud trends.</li>
      <li><strong>Transactions Debited in the Last 120 Days:</strong> Ensures inclusion of relevant transactions within the chargeback eligibility window.</li>
      <li><strong>120 to 112 Days Range:</strong> Prioritizes transactions close to the chargeback deadline to prevent missed recovery opportunities.</li>
      <li><strong>Exclude Chargeback-Completed Transactions:</strong> Avoids redundant work by removing already resolved cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Check for Merchant Credits:</strong> Identifies accounts already compensated, reducing unnecessary follow-ups.</li>
      <li><strong>Exclude Duplicates:</strong> Ensures efficient processing by avoiding reworking flagged transactions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Requirements for Script Decisions:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accurate Date Logic:</strong> Ensure the script calculates date ranges (last 10 days, 120 days, and 112 days) dynamically based on the current date.</li>
      <li><strong>Fraud Flag Identification:</strong> Use consistent criteria to identify fraud-flagged transactions from the inbound recoverable dataset.</li>
      <li><strong>Chargeback Status Verification:</strong> Ensure reliable data sources to check if chargebacks have been actioned and extract corresponding dates.</li>
      <li><strong>Merchant Credit Check:</strong> Access accurate credit transaction records linked to accounts in the dataset.</li>
      <li><strong>Deduplication:</strong> Implement logic to compare with yesterdayâ€™s flagged cases effectively to avoid duplicates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
