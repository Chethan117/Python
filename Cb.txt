Background:
Ethoca chargebacks can be "out of time" when they fall outside the prescribed time frame for initiating a chargeback, often set by the card networks (e.g., Visa, MasterCard). Chargebacks are typically subject to specific timelines, and transactions that fall outside these timelines are no longer eligible for chargeback resolution. Identifying "out of time" chargebacks helps to ensure that only valid chargebacks are processed.

Intent:
The intent is to identify and handle chargebacks that fall outside the acceptable time window, ensuring that transactions are not incorrectly disputed after the allowed period has passed. This ensures compliance with card network rules and prevents unnecessary chargeback processing.


Method:
Base Data from Recoverable Inbound Fraud: Pull the base data from the recoverable inbound fraud dataset for the last 10 days. This provides the recent transactions eligible for chargeback review.
Identify Chargeback Time Window: Determine the allowed time window for chargebacks (e.g., 120 days from the transaction date).
Filter Out of Time Chargebacks: Use SQL or another data processing tool to filter out transactions from the base data that fall outside the time window (e.g., transactions older than 120 days from the transaction date).


Exclude Invalid Chargebacks: Mark or exclude the chargebacks identified as "out of time" from further processing to prevent them from being investigated or disputed.
Reporting: Generate reports to track the "out of time" chargebacks, ensuring that they are not included in chargeback processing and are reviewed by stakeholders for compliance.
