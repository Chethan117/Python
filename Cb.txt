Method: Fraud Transaction Extraction and Processing
Extract Recent Fraud Transactions:

Identify transactions from the inbound recoverable dataset that were flagged as fraud in the last 10 days.
Filter for Debit Transactions:

From the extracted transactions, filter those that were debited within the last 120 days from Visa or MasterCard merchants.
Identify Older Debit Transactions:

Further filter transactions to include only those that occurred between 120 days and 112 days from the current date.
Check for Chargebacks:

For the transactions identified in the previous step, check if a chargeback has been actioned. Extract the chargeback date and exclude transactions where chargebacks have been completed.
Check for Merchant Credits:

For the remaining transactions, verify if there are any credits from the merchant for the associated accounts.
Avoid Duplicates:

Compare the extracted transactions with yesterday's flagged cases to ensure no duplicate transactions are included.
Push Non-Worked Transactions to Tables:

Add all non-duplicate transactions to the daily table and the repo table.
Send to Operational Workstream:

Share the final list of transactions with the operational workstream for further action and resolution.
Script Decisions:
