Background
In the finance fraud domain, organizations continuously monitor customer accounts to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure the integrity of customer information. One key aspect of this monitoring involves tracking changes in customer data, such as address modifications. Fraudsters often exploit outdated or incorrect information, making it crucial for financial institutions to maintain accurate records.

A Change of Address (COA) letter serves as an official request from customers to update their registered address. Monitoring these changes is essential for identifying potential fraudulent activities, as discrepancies in address changes may signal identity theft or other fraudulent schemes.

Intent
The intent of the SQL query is to identify accounts that meet the following criteria:

Active accounts as of the previous day.
Established mobile numbers to facilitate communication and verification processes.
Accounts that have issued a Change of Address letter, which may indicate an increased risk of fraud if the address change appears suspicious or inconsistent.
By retrieving this data, the organization can:

Perform targeted investigations on accounts with recent address changes, particularly those with established mobile numbers, to verify legitimacy.
Enhance customer outreach to confirm address changes and gather additional information.
Analyze patterns related to address changes in connection with fraud investigations to improve detection and prevention strategies.
